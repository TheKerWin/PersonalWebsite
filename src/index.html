        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in a small-not-so-small town called Norwalk CT, and grew up with a huge curiosity for technology and innovation. I took my first Computer Science class as a freshman in High School back in 2012, I am currently a college student at the University of Connecticut majoring in CS, to still be doing Computer Science years later is a great accomplishment of mine. On my spare time I like to read books, play music, workout and draw things that come to my mind. I am currently reading Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. I learned to play the harmonica then the piano. Sitting all day on a desk can be really taxing on health so I lift as much as I can. Also I like to draw cartoons that resonate with me from my childhood.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>My one goal is to get better, I thrive on knowing that I can be better tomorrow than I am today and that I have to practice consistently because I can never be the best, there will always be someone better. I find joy in getting better, imagining what is out there that is better than me and imagining what is even beyond that. I constantly feel that I can do so much more(work, progress, contributions to Industry, company, people) than what I am doing now. I have made it this far in my career, why can I not go further? I see every failure as a reason that I need to keep going and I see every success all the more reason not to stop. I am a software engineer but there is no doubt in my mind that one day I can be “The Software Engineer.

        <h3>What I am doing now</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the University of Connecticut. I am working with Professor Phillip Bradford on pushing his path labeled libraries for All-Pairs-Shortest-Paths with Small Edge Weights. It is based on the work by Computer Scientists Zvi Galil and Oded Margalit.
          In addition I am the conference chair for the 2020 New England Latinx Student Leadership Conference being hosted by PRLACC(Puerto Rican/Latin American Cultural Center) at UConn.

        <h3>What I am doing in 6 months</h3>
        <p>
          What I am looking forward to is working on many summer projects. I am trying to save to money so that I may build a smart mirror using a monitor and Raspberry Pi. I plan to buy some Arduino kits to get myself more acquainted with hardware, circuits and embedded systems. I plan to familiarize myself with 3D modeling Software and architectural software. I hope to participate in open source projects on github. I periodically view industry trends and what types of software are being used, I am very interested in expanding my knowledge over more frameworks and technologies. This fall will begin my final year as a University Student, I hope to finish strong and enter the industry and interact with other engineers, clients, and people as quickly as possible.
