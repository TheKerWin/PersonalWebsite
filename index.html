        </div>
        <p>I was born and raised in a small-not-so-small town called Norwalk CT, I grew up with a huge curiosity for technology and innovation. I took my first Computer Science class as a freshman in High School back in 2012,
          I am currently a college student at the University of Connecticut majoring in CS, to still be doing Computer Science years later is a great accomplishment of mine.
          On my spare time I like to read books, play music, workout and draw things that come to my mind.
          I am currently reading Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. I learned to play the harmonica then the piano.
          Sitting all day on a desk can be really taxing on health so I lift as much as I can. Also I like to draw cartoons that resonate with me from my childhood.

            <p>
            I recently started designing websites!
            I am interested in backend design because of analyzing
            software architecture and the technicalities.
            I am familiar with MySQL Databases and
            I have worked with Angular 6 framework and have prior experience in React-Native.

            <p>
            Software Engineering is my main trade. I do most of my work in Java or Python,
             but I do have skills in C and prior experience with C++.
            I have a passion to code because
            I feel that the projects I have contributed to have
            improved other people's lives.

              Having worked at University of Connecticut UTIS Technical support,

              From fixing the broken printer in the office to recovering important client data,
              there is not much that I cannot do!

          <p>
            Last summer, I traveled to Charlotte,
            North Carolina to do Undergraduate Research for Software defined networking.
            My team and I developed a dynamic platform and controller for SDN applications using Angular, IPOPO and python.
            The purpose of this research was to simplify the
            management and visualization of networks topologies and infrastructure.

          <p>
            For our final assignment in my “Intro to Software Engineer” course we created a robust Hospital Utility system using Java.
            It was very interesting on nitpicking the pros and cons of JavaFX and Swing.
            All of the code is on my Github!
